  >The H.264 Spec
  
  >H.264 is a video compression technology, or codec, that was jointly developed by the **International Telecommunications Union** (as H.264) and **International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission Moving Picture Experts Group** (as MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced Video Coding, or AVC). Thus, the terms H.264 and AVC mean the same thing and are interchangeable.
